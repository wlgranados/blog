So I get a lot of comments when people learn that I've been playing a bland looking RPG for the past 10 years. 
Well, today, I plan to take a trip down memory lane. 

## The Game: Torn City

To give you an idea of what the game is like, let's look at the description: "Torn is a text-based online RPG set in Torn City, a dark, murky underworld where only the sharpest survive. In Torn City you can be anyone and do anything. Build your character to infinite strengths and play it."

Now, how can such a bland looking game manage to keep my attention for the past 10 years, you may ask? Well, it's actually a very feature rich text-based game that has many people around the globe addicted. I've known of several people who tried to quit the game, only to come back to it in a few years full circle. What could possibly be the reason for this?

## The Older Past(10 yrs ago)

I'm about 3900 days old today, which means I made my account around May 2009. My first encounter with the game was a few years back on a school computer (2007-2008).

When I first encountered the game, I didn't think much of it. I mean, the grey colour is not all that appealing to the eye.
And honestly I have forgotten the password/username/email associated with that account. It wasn't until a few years later that I found my cousin playing Torn and this caught my interest again. 

Back in those days the only popular games I knew of were <a href="https://www.y8.com/games/playing_with_fire_2">playing with fire</a>, and  <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/"> newgrounds</a>. I also had a pretty slow computer so I couldn't really play any intensive games like runescape.

While I was playing these games I met a lot of cool people from around the world, who resided in: UK, Scotland, UAE, and from the US. I learned a lot about their cultures, and I remember spending nights on messengers talking about hunting the <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-is-haggis">wild haggis</a>. Most of these people were from a different game I played at the time called <a href="http://citystruggle.com/">city struggle</a>, however that game was shut down sometime around 2011, due to unforeseen reasons. So a lot of us migrated to torn city, and the few who didn't remain a mystery (like ViralVengeance, leader of Deviance).

So, since CS was a pretty big part of my life, I stayed in contact with the few people still on torn. But over the next year those people became less active. This lonesome year resulted in me taking a three year hiatus (around the time highschool started). 

## The Old Past (6 yrs ago)

During my final year of highschool around the time I was stressing about getting into University, I decided to take a break from it all and play a little bit of torn. One thing led to another and I found myself now trying to reach the "stat cap" milestone in each category. I thought to myself if I was gonna get serious at any point in this game, having reached the stat cap would be useful.

It was around this time I made a new group of friends in a faction called Sadistic which was run by a business student in Myanmar, and US veteran. While I was there I learned about "chaining" attacks feature which involved users staying up to make attacks on other users in 5 min windows, to raise a hit counter. This was pretty fun since it required a lot of communication and grit to be able to get some longer chains going like the 500 ones. Unfortunately this experience didn't last long when the team disbanded, so I joined a bigger faction at the time called Momento Mori (M†M). 

I started getting more involved in the scene since M†M was a top 20 faction at the time. They weren't pushovers either, and they frequently did much longer chains than the ones in Sadistic (in the realm of 1000-5000) since they had a larger active userbase. I leanrned a fair bit of warring and chaining from that faction which I'm very grateful for. Unfortunately this faction didn't last long either once the leader Tascon decided to sell it.  
 
## The Somewhat Present - Now (2 yrs ago)

At this point I managed to reach the goal I wanted but I wasn't really fully set on the game, so I decided to join another top 20 faction called destructive angels (sister faction of destructive anomoly [top 5 faction]). I thought, "maybe I could move up to the top faction". Unfortunately, this faction ended up disbanding disbanding. And at the time I remember how difficult it would be to have 10k chains.

So I decided I wanted to join a really active faction where I could basically be lazy asf and just throw in my hits during the exam season without worrying to keep the chain alive. So at the time I remember seeing 39th Street Killers X (X stands for elite) they were doing 25k chains effortlessly over weekends and pulling in a lot of money through organised crimes. Keep in mind a 10k chain might take me a week to do in my old factions, so I was very impressed.  I talked with the faction leader, told him about my history and I mentioned the points above, and just like that I was in. After years of not being sure if I'd play legitimately I was now in a top 5 faction, and my overall in game stats were starting to look a lot better. 

I've been in the faction for a year now and moved up to main faction (39th Street Killers), and honestly I feel like my decision back then was right. There are lots of smart and dedicated people here, and I feel like I keep meeting new intersting people. Well let's see how long this will last :)
