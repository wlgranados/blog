Welcome to my blog! I have recently decided to port over my blog from wgma00.me
to this site wgma.ca. Currently this blog is using the Jekyll, which makes the
writing blogs easier with markdown. 

To kick things here is one of my favourite xkcd comics. It demonstrtes the
banter I have with some of my friends about the best editor for a "real programmer" (which is vim hands down).
